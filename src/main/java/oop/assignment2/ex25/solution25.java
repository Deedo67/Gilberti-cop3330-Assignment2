// Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:
// A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
// A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
// A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
// A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.

// Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value you can evaluate
// to determine the password strength. Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple
// languages in the future.
// Use a single output statement.
